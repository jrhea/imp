# Imp: ðŸ˜ˆ Eth2 Network Agent ðŸ˜ˆ

**Imp** is a semi-autonomous network agent designed to crawl the eth2 network an collect data that will be used to monitor the network health in realtime.

## Prereqs ( MacOS )

Rust:

Install rustup so you can switch between Rust versions:

```sh

> brew install rustup

```

Install the Rust compiler and package manager:

```sh

> rustup-init

```

Tmux (Optional):

Installing this will make running the demo easier:

```sh

> brew install tmux

```

## How to Build

Clone the repo:

```sh

> git clone https://github.com/prrkl/imp.git

```

For convenience, a Makefile is provided to alias the different build options with the following targets:

### debug

This build target is for developers and used (obviously) for debugging.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`make debug`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equivalent to: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`cargo build`

### release

If you just want to run **imp**, then use this target.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`make release`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equivalent to: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`cargo build --release`

### local

This is an option for developers.  It is a convenient was to reference packages, like [mothra](https://github.com/prrkl/mothra), that are being developed along with **imp**.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`make local`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equivalent to: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`cargo build --features "local" --no-default-features`

## How to run

**Imp** is early in development and has limited functionality; however, if you want to play around with it, then I suggest running the demo script.

```sh

> cd scripts && sh demo.sh

```

Here is a glimpse of the available options:
